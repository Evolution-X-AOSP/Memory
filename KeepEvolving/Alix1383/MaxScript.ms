print "Alix(SenPai) - With love from Kavar Shiraz, IRAN"
-- "Alix(SenPai) - With love from Kavar Shiraz, IRAN"


-- Note that MAXScript is expression-based, so simply writing "Alix(SenPai) - With love from Kavar Shiraz, IRAN" is
-- sufficient to echo it for the reader. Like Haskell, all MAXScript expressions
-- *must* return values, even if they're unused.
