# Memories of Evolution X

**What's the purpose of this repository?**

Akito Mizukito: I wanted to do something creative, something no one in the community has ever done before.

**How do we (the community) participate?**

It's quite simple!

You create a folder in /KeepEvolving and name it using your GitHub username!

For example, KeepEvolving/RealAkito

Then create a file called KeepEvolving.ext (By .ext it can be .txt, .py, .sh, .go, js and much more!) then type KeepEvolving in your countries' language!

~~ Example ~~
KeepEvolving.txt
`進化し続ける - With love from Tokyo, Japan`

(You can make more than one KeepEvolving file, e.g. in python as KeepEvolving.py)

## Historical Information

**Evolution X, by Joey Huab (@Stallix) and Co-founders, Akito Mizukito (@RealAkito) & Anierin Bliss (@AnierinB)**


### Why was Evolution X created?

Joey Huab: I wanted to build my own version of a Pixel ROM, but Pixel Experience already beat me to it. I applied for official maintainership on Tissot instead. A few months after my first build, my maintainership was revoked. I continued compiling unofficial builds until I decided that I should build my own ROM. And that's where all of this started!

### Why did Pixel Experience revoke my maintainership status?

I included VoLTE icon support into an official build.

### What do we have planned next?

Evolution X bringup for Android Q once Google publicly releases the source codes!
